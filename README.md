## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey of SOLID principles in software development. Created on June 29, 2025, it serves as both a personal reference and a potential guide for others interested in understanding and applying these fundamental object-oriented design principles.

## Content Organization

For each SOLID principle, you'll find:

1. **Violation/** - Examples demonstrating violations of the principle
2. **Valid/** - Refactored examples showing proper application of the principle
3. **[PrincipleName].md** - Comprehensive explanation of the principle, including:
   - Definition
   - Practical examples
   - References used in learning this principle

## Extra Takeaways

The `ExtraTakeAways/` directory contains additional learning materials on related topics that I encountered during my SOLID principles journey

## References

Each principle's markdown file contains its own set of references that were used to understand and document that principle. This keeps the reference materials organized and contextually relevant.
